                    <p>Glad to welcome you here! I'm 28 years old. I graduated from the Moscow Aviation Institute and
                        immediately started working as a design engineer in the aerospace industry for about 4 years.
                        For the last year I have been actively studying the direction of the Frontend Developer.<br>
                        My employer supported my activity and I managed to complete the external courses at Nordic IT
                        School (September 2021 - April 2022) in Frontend Developer position.<br>
                        Since January 2022, I have been applying my skills in the development of an internal
                        educational portal.
                        <br>I currently have 5 months experience. I liked this experience and I want to further develop
                        in this direction in new commercial projects.
